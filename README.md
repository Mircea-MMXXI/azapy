### Contents
A. Risk based portfolio optimization algorithms:
  1. mCVaR - mixture CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)
  2. mSMCR - mixture SMCR (Second Moment Coherent Risk)
  3. mMAD - m-level MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation)
  4. mLSSD - m-level LSSD (Lower Standard Semi-Deviation)
  5. mBTAD - mixture BTAD (Below Threshold Absolute Deviation)
  6. mBTSD - mixture BTSD (Below Threshold Standard Deviation)
  7. GINI - Gini index (as in Corrado Gini statistician 1884-1965)
  8. MV - mean-variance
  9. SD - standard deviation

For each class of portfolios the following optimization strategies are
available:
  1. Minimization of dispersion for targeted expected rate of return
  2. Maximization of generalized Sharpe ratio
  3. Minimization of inverse of generalized Sharpe ratio
  4. Minimum dispersion portfolio
  5. Maximization of expected rate of return for a risk vale generated by a
  benchmark portfolio (*e.g.* same risk as equal weighted portfolio)
  6. Maximization of expected rate of returns for a fixed value of
     risk-aversion factor

B. "Na√Øve" portfolio strategies:
  1. Constant weighted portfolio. A particular case is equal
     weighted portfolio.
  2. Inverse volatility portfolio (*i.e.* portfolio weights are proportional to
     the inverse of asset volatilities)
  3. Inverse variance portfolio (*i.e.* portfolio weights are proportional to
     the inverse of asset variances)
  4. Inverse drawdown portfolio (*i.e.* portfolio weights are proportional to
     the asset absolute value of maximum drawdowns over a predefined
     historical period)

C. Greedy portfolio optimization strategies:
  1. Kelly's portfolio (as in John Larry Kelly Jr. scientist 1923-1965) -
     maximization of portfolio log returns

Utility functions:
  * Collect historical market data from various providers.
    Supported providers:

    - yahoo.com
    - eodhistoricaldata.com
    - alphavantage.co
    - marketstack.com

  * Generate business calendars. At this point only NYSE business calendar
    is implemented.
  * Generate rebalancing portfolio schedules.
  * Append a cash-like security to an existing market data object.
  * Update market data saved in a directory.
