Financial Portfolio Optimization Analytics

A. Classical algorithms based on
  1. CVaR (conditional value at risk)
  2. SMCR (second momentum coherent risk)
  3. MV (mean variance)
  5. GINI (as in Corrado Gini - statistician 1884-1965)
  4. MAD (mean absolute deviation)
  5. Gini (as in Corrado Gini - statistician 1884-1965)
  6. Omeaga ratio (introduced by Con Keating and William F. Shadwick in 2002)

In each case the optimization strategies are
1. Minimization of the dispersion.
2. Minimum optimal dispersion.
3. Generalized Sharpe maximization.
4. Optimal portfolio with the same dispersion as the equally weighted portfolio.
