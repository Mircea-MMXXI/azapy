# GINI-based optimal portfolios

GINI index, also called GINI ratio or GINI coefficient, is a measure
of statistical dispersion introduced by sociologist *Gini Corrado (1884-1965)*.
In Finance it is defined as:

\begin{equation*}
	{\rm Gini} = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^N |r_i -r_j|
\end{equation*}

where:

* $N$ is the number of historical observations,
* $r_i$ is the i-th observation of portfolio historical rates of return.

> Note: In general, Gini optimal portfolio strategies have a computational
complexity of ${\cal O}(N^2)$. Thus, the
computational time increases quadratic with the number of historical
observations. This is the main computational inconvenience for any
portfolio optimizations based on this
dispersion measure.

The following portfolio optimization strategies are available:
* Minimization of risk for targeted expected rate of return value,
* Minimum risk portfolio,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a risk vale generated by a
benchmark portfolio (*e.g.* same risk as equal weighted portfolio),
* Maximization of expected rate of return for fixed risk-aversion factor,
* Maximization of Gini-Sharpe ratio,
* Minimization of the inverse of Gini-Sharpe ratio.

There are 2 support classes:

* **GINIAnalyzer** : computes the portfolio weights and performs in-sample
analysis,
* **Port_GINI** : performs portfolio back testing, out-of-sample analysis.
