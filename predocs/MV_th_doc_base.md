# MV optimal portfolios

MV stands for *Mean Variance*.
The MV optimal portfolio was
introduced by the economist Harry Max Markowitz in 1952. It was the main
body of work that later had triggered the development of
*Modern Portfolio Theory* (MPT).


The MV model dispersion measure is the portfolio variance, *i.e.*,

\begin{equation*}
	{\rm var} = w^T C w,
\end{equation*}

where:

* $w$ is the vector of portfolio weights,
* $C$ is the covariance matrix between portfolio components.

> Note: In our case $C$ is estimated from historical observations of
portfolio components rate of returns.

The following portfolio optimization strategies are available:
* Minimization of dispersion for targeted expected rate of return,
* Maximization of Sharpe ratio,
* Minimization of the inverse of Sharpe ratio,
* Minimum dispersion portfolio,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a risk vale generated by a
benchmark portfolio (*e.g.* same risk as equal weighted portfolio),
* Maximization of expected rate of returns for fixed risk-aversion factor.

There are 2 support classes:

* **MVAnalyzer** : computes the portfolio weights and performs in-sample
analysis,
* **Port_MV** : performs portfolio back testing, out-of-sample analysis.
