This is a generic class for backtesting a portfolio with an arbitrary
rebalancing schedule. The schedule and the weights prevailing
at each rebalancing date must be provided by the user.

It is intended as a backtesting tool for new portfolio strategies before
integrating them in a more robust backtesting module.
