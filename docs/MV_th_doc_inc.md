MV stands for *Mean Variance*.
The MV optimal portfolio was
introduced by the economist H.M. Markowitz in 1952. It was the main
body of work that later had triggered the development of
*Modern Portfolio Theory* (MPT).


Variance is the dispersion measure for MV-based optimal portfolio
models, *i.e.*,

\begin{equation*}
	{\rm VAR} = w^T C w,
\end{equation*}

where:

* $w$ is the vector of portfolio weights,
* $C$ is the covariance matrix between portfolio components.

> Note: In our case $C$ is estimated from historical observations of
portfolio components rate of return.

The following portfolio optimization strategies are available:
* Minimization of risk for targeted expected rate of return value,
* Minimum risk portfolio,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a risk vale generated by a
benchmark portfolio (*e.g.* same risk as equal weighted portfolio),
* Maximization of expected rate of return for fixed risk-aversion factor,
* Maximization of MV-Sharpe ratio,
* Minimization of the inverse of MV-Sharpe ratio,
* Maximum diversified portfolio <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a diversification factor value
generated by a benchmark portfolio (e.g., same diversification factor as
equal weighted portfolio) <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>,
* Maximization of diversification factor for an expected rate of return
generated by a benchmark portfolio (e.g., same diversification factor as
equal weighted portfolio) <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>.

__The rigorous mathematical description of these strategies is presented

There are 2 support classes:

* [**MVAnalyzer**](azapy.Analyzers.MVAnalyzer.MVAnalyzer):
computes the portfolio weights and performs in-sample analysis,
* [**Port_MV**](azapy.PortOpt.Port_MV.Port_MV) :
performs portfolio backtesting, out-of-sample analysis.
