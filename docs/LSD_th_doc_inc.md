LSD stands for *Lower Semi-Deviation*.

**azapy** implements a generalization of LSD,
namely the *m-level LSD* (mLSD).

mLSD dispersion measure is defined as

\begin{equation*}
	{\rm mLSD} = \sum_{l=1}^L {\cal K}_l \times \delta_l^{(2)}
\end{equation*}

where:

* $L$ is the mLSD level,
* $\{{\cal K}_l\}_{l=1,\cdots,L}$ is a set of positive non-increasing
coefficients normalized to unit,
* $\delta_l^{(2)}$ is the l-th order delta-risk of second rank, defined
successively as

\begin{align*}
  \delta_1^{(2)}(r) & = \left\|\left( -{\bar r} \right)^+\right\|_2,
	&\cdots \\
	\delta_l^{(2)}(r) &= \left\|\left( -{\bar r} -\sum_{j=1}^{l-1}\delta_j^{(2)}(r)\right)^+\right\|_2, \\
\end{align*}
where $\left\| \cdot \right\|_2 = \left( E\left[\left| \cdot \right|^2\right]\right)^{1/2}$,
is the $L_2$ norm and $\bar r$ is the detrended rate of return,
${\bar r} = r - E[r]$. In this notation $\delta_1^{(2)}$ is the LSD.

> Note: a possible choice could be $L=3$ and ${\cal K}_l=1/3\ \ \forall l$.

The following portfolio optimization strategies are available:
* Minimization of risk for targeted expected rate of return value,
* Minimum risk portfolio,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a risk vale generated by a
benchmark portfolio (*e.g.* same risk as equal weighted portfolio),
* Maximization of expected rate of return for fixed risk-aversion factor,
* Maximization of mLSD-Sharpe ratio,
* Minimization of the inverse of mLSD-Sharpe ratio,
* Maximum diversified portfolio <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>,
* Maximization of expected rate of return for a diversification factor value
generated by a benchmark portfolio (e.g., same diversification factor as
equal weighted portfolio) <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>,
* Maximization of diversification factor for an expected rate of return
generated by a benchmark portfolio (e.g., same diversification factor as
equal weighted portfolio) <span style="color:blue">(beta version)</span>.

__The rigorous mathematical description of these strategies is presented
[here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4205165).__

There are 2 support classes:

* [**LSDAnalyzer**](azapy.Analyzers.LSDAnalyzer.LSDAnalyzer):
computes the portfolio weights and performs in-sample analysis,
* [**Port_LSD**](azapy.PortOpt.Port_LSD.Port_LSD) :
performs portfolio backtesting, out-of-sample analysis.
