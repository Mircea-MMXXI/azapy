A *Buy and Hold* strategy assumes that at some point in time the entire capital
is invested in a portfolio with fixed composition, i.e., fixed numbers of shares.
After that, the portfolio is held until its liquidation.
No rebalancing is involved.

The backtesting of this strategy could be viewed as a performance benchmark.

There is 1 support class:


* [**Port_Simple**](azapy.Generators.Port_Simple.Port_Simple) :
performs portfolio backtesting, out-of-sample analysis.

The `Port_Simple` class can be used also as a tool to compare the performance
of multiple portfolios if their time-series are known.
